# variant
Unions are a powerful tool in the right hands,
but they can certainly made better, and more "c++"-ish.
Variant introduces type safety into unions, and will help 
express your intents more cleanly, while being less error prone.

This is a naive implementation of a variant (= type safe union),
its not for production use - but its a starting point template :)
You can use this as a reference while we wait for std::variant to be 
approved by the committee.

check out the usage.cpp !
